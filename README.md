## Description

Maybe you have a list of "tasks" in a folder that serves as a way of organizing client information. Maybe you have a few tasks relating to a particular client. How do you navigate back to the client's information "task" from the current task you're working on? 

This Chrome extension will insert a link back to the client's information "task" into the taskbar of the currently opened task. 

The extension reads the task's tags looking for the name of the client, and then searches a dedicated database table for the link associated with that client.
